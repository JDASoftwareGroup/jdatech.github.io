Last but not least, in our final Part 5 of our PyCon.DE series weÂ´ll present our talk "No Compromise: Use Ansible properly or stick to your scripts". What you do within this IT automation tool should be clean an simple. Watch this talk to get more insights into Blue Yonder utilizing progressively Ansible to deploy the data science infrastructure.  [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) should help you to orchestrate your systems, automate the deployments and set up well defined infrastructures. But if you want to make something work quickly, the chances are high that you fall back to shell/command tasks, the mother of all evil. Those tasks usually prevent you from running dry runs where you would see the upcoming changes and you prevent Ansible to shine. So, we went blindly into every deployment and hoped the best. But we wanted to see what would change, we wanted to make Ansible - check work again and therefore in this talk we will show you what we did wrong and what we changed to get there. Bjoern Meier is a software engineer at Blue Yonder GmbH since 2016 after graduating in Computer Science. More correctly you could say he is a DevOps engineer at Blue Yonder where he is developing and operating - among other things - the services for the external data interfaces, preprocessing and data storage to enable the data scientists to run their prediction models.
