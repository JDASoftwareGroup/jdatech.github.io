In the month of July 2018, JDA announced the acquisition of Blue Yonder. As part of
the integration we are happy to announce that the Blue Yonder Tech blog
will continue its life as the JDA Tech blog. All Blue Yonder blog posts have been moved
to this blog.

In addition to the blog posts, the Blue Yonder associates have infected JDA with
their enthusiasm for open source software development and contributions. 
Historically, JDA has not been very active in this space. This has changed. 

Expect exciting new open source contribution on GitHub under the 
[JDA](https://github.com/JDASoftwareGroup) organization. We will, step by step, 
migrate projects from the [Blue Yonder](https://github.com/blue-yonder) 
organization to the new home.

Continue to follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/TechJda) and meet us at conferences.
