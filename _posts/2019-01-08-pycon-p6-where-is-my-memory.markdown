The 6th Part of the PyCon.DE 2018 series is about the Python memory management and why you should know a few details about it even while writing pure Python code. After the talk, you will have a better understanding of what is going on in the interpreter, together with a few tools and best practices. 

PyCon.DE is where Pythonistas in Germany can meet to learn about new and upcoming Python libraries, tools, software, and data science. In 2018 we had more than 500 participants in Karlsruhe, a city where approximately 3600 IT companies with more than 36000 jobs exist.  

Something most Python users do not bother with is the memory management. Surely it is easy, letting the garbage collector handle all the trash and focus on other aspects of your program. But to unleash the full power of your application it is worthwhile to peek behind the curtains. 

In the talk, we will still your fears of the memory management and provide you with the necessities to face it, by using real-life examples in which we show how to use the garbage collector and open source tooling to take control over disposable memory you may not even know you had.
